# JGraphicEngine  

A personal graphics engine built with **C++ and OpenGL**, created as a way to explore and learn modern rendering techniques.  
Itâ€™s a work-in-progress project that grows over time as I experiment with new features.  

## Features  
- Written in C++ with OpenGL  
- Basic rendering pipeline  
- Modern rendering practices (in progress)  
- Expandable and evolving with new experiments
